# File Encryption Tool Using Win32 API

This is a GUI based Tool using C++ and WinAPI to encrypt files

This makes use of the Windows native API in the header `windows.h` in C++

## Why I am using Win API ?

I chose to use the Windows API (WinAPI) for this encryption tool to gain a deeper understanding of Windows' underlying architecture. By working directly with WinAPI, I am able to engage with the native interfaces and mechanisms of the operating system, bypassing the abstractions and simplifications provided by higher-level frameworks. This approach allows me to learn about the core functionalities and low-level operations that drive Windows, thus enriching my knowledge and skills in system programming and Windows internals.
